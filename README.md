# Google-Job-Posting-Analysis
I will be Analysing Data Analyst Job Postings and then visualising the data on Streamlit.

# Data Cleaning
I will be doing this on Jupyter Notebooks(Data_Cleaning.ipynb). I will be exporting my cleaned data in the files Cleaned.csv and Skills.csv. The Skills.csv will only include the count of job skills required in the postings and the Cleaned.csv will include the rest of the information. The two csv can be concated later if needed in my Streamlit app.
